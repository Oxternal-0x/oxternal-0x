System Architect & Master Educator
Location: Chicago, IL 

##Executive Summary
  A "Master of Craft" transitioning from 17+ years in high-stakes physical manufacturing and technical education into Web3 and AI systems. Proven track record of scaling human capital—having mentored numerous apprentices into successful professional careers—and managing complex educational operations. Currently focused on building        resilient decentralized systems, attribution models, and "Digital Guilds."

## 🛠️ Core Competencies
   * Systemic Resilience: Expert in "Brittle System" theory—understanding how complex structures (physical and digital) hold together under pressure.

  * Technical Instruction: Former founder of Unbroken Glass Learning Center; experienced in developing curriculum for non-accredited and workforce development programs (ICC).

  * Web3 Operations: Proficient in DAO deployment, NFT architecture, and contribution tracking.

  * Development: Python (Active Learning), Solidity (Literate), and Open Source contribution (GitHub).

## 🌪️ The "Bridge" Philosophy: From Glass to Governance
  In glass blowing, the difference between a masterpiece and a pile of shards is temperature control and timing. I apply this same "Tempered" approach to software and community building:

  Attribution: Just as a glass studio requires clear roles, digital guilds require clear "Proof of Contribution."

  Mentorship: My success is measured by the 70% retention rate of my apprentices in the trade. I build people, not just products.

  Operations: Experience running a supply and learning center means I understand the "Full Stack" of a business, from inventory to education.

## 🚀 Featured Projects
  The Attribution Plugin  https://github.com/Oxternal-0x/Attribution-Plugin
  A framework designed to solve the "Value Gap" in collaborative environments.

  Focuses on how to track and reward individual contributions within a shared codebase or project.

##Goals & Objectives
  Seeking a role as a DAO Operations Lead, Technical Education Specialist, or System Architect where I can apply my experience in mentorship and "Master/Apprentice" frameworks to the future of decentralized work.
